You need to start learning to feed yourself. Hopefully as you have worked through this book, you have learned that all the information you need is on the internet, you just have to go search for it. The only thing you have been missing are the right words and what to look for when you search. Now you should have a sense of it, so it's about time you struggled through a big project and tried to get it working. 
Here are your requirements:
	1. Make a different game from the one I made.
	2. Use more than one file, and use import to use them. Make sure you know what it is.
	3. Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their purposek. Like GoldRoom, KoiPondRoom.
	4. Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
